    <p>My name is Oussama, I am 29 years old, and I am <strong>Algerian</strong>. I have been living in Canada for two years as an international student for the 1<sup>st</sup> year at <em>Algonquin College</em>. My program is <mark> <aabr title ="interactive media design"> IMD </aabr></mark>. I chose it because I love photography, website creation, and everything related to design</p>
    <p>Through this program, I want to improve my creative and technical skills. I also hope to learn more about digital marketing, branding, and user experience. In the future, I would like to work in the design industry and build my own creative business online</p>
